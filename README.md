Welcome to Aspiration Station! Aspiration Station provides a medium to create and track your goals and aspirations in one place. In addition, you can add inspirational quotes to aid you along your journey.

To get started, clone this repo, and change directories into ~/aspiration-station. Next, clone down the aspiration_station_backend repo, which can be found here - https://github.com/MichaelSchiumo/aspiration-station-backend.

Once you have each of these repositories cloned and open in separate tabs within your terminal, you can run the following commands:

  -For the backend, run 'rails s -p 3001'
  
  -For the frontend, run 'npm install -g serve" followed by "serve -s build"


  Once you have the server running on your local machine, the application should open in your browser. Once there, simply click the 'Get Started' link, and you will be able to create a profile, add and delete aspirations and quotes, and view some preloaded content to inspire you to achieve your dreams!
